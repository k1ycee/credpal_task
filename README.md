Credpal Interview Task

## Assumprtions

I assumed that the tasks goal is to see if I can make something similar to the original, I made this assumption because I noticed that some of the images are off, so I used images that would render and I did my best to write the code in such a way that it you wanted to increase or reduce the UI elements the code allowed for that.
